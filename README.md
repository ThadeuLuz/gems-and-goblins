# Gems and Goblins - AI Character Creator

An AI-powered character creator for Old School Renaissance (OSR) tabletop role-playing games, built with Google's Genkit Flows. This project serves as a gentle introduction to Genkit while providing a functional character generation tool for classic RPG systems.

## 🎲 Overview

Gems and Goblins is a web-based character creator that generates complete character sheets for OSR games using AI. The application features a minimalist black-and-white interface inspired by 80s print materials, with AI-generated character details and artwork.

## 🎯 Supported Game Systems

The character creator is designed with these OSR systems in mind, and can be easily adapted to most OSR compatible game systems.

## ✨ Features

### Character Sheet Properties

Each generated character includes:

**Attributes (Rolled with the classic "3d6 in order" method):**

- Strength
- Constitution
- Dexterity
- Intelligence
- Wisdom
- Charisma

**Text Fields (AI-generated by Gemini):**

- Name
- Ancestry
- Class
- Alignment
- Background
- Inventory Items (AI-generated)

**Character Portrait (AI-generated black & white sketch):**

### Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist Interface**: Clean black and white design matching 80s print aesthetics
- **Simple Interaction**: Single "Roll" button for character generation
- **Authentic Art Style**: Black and white character portraits with jagged edges and rough pen-and-ink feel
- **Demo-Focused**: Well-documented code serving as a Genkit Flows introduction

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (hosting/)

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Minimalist CSS with black and white theme
- **Components**: Character sheet layout with roll functionality

### Backend (functions/)

- **Platform**: Firebase Functions
- **AI Integration**: Google Genkit Flows
- **Character Generation**: Multi-step AI workflow

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Firebase CLI
- Google Cloud Project with Genkit enabled

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd GemsAndGoblins
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd hosting
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../functions
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**

   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase use --add
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   # In functions/ directory
   firebase functions:config:set genkit.api_key="your-genkit-api-key"
   ```

5. **Deploy the application**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Access the application** at your Firebase hosting URL
2. **Click "Roll"** to generate a new character
3. **View the generated character sheet** with all attributes, details, and portrait
4. **Download or print** the character sheet for your OSR game

## 🔄 Character Creation Process

The character generation follows a three-step AI workflow:

### Step 1: Attribute Generation

- Frontend rolls 3d6 for each attribute in order
- Results are displayed on the character sheet

### Step 2: Character Details Generation

- Genkit Flow analyzes the attributes
- Generates appropriate name, ancestry, class, alignment, and background
- Creates a thematic inventory list

### Step 3: Character Portrait Generation

- Genkit Flow creates an image prompt based on character details
- Generates a black and white character portrait
- Applies pen-and-ink sketch styling

### Key Components

- **Field.tsx**: Character attribute display component
- **Layout.tsx**: Main application layout
- **sheet.tsx**: Character sheet component
- **schemas.ts**: TypeScript schemas for character data

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Game Systems

1. Modify the character sheet layout in `hosting/src/components/sheet.tsx`
2. Update the Genkit Flow prompts in `functions/src/index.ts`
3. Adjust attribute ranges and class options as needed

### Styling Changes

The minimalist design can be customized in:

- `hosting/src/index.css` - Global styles
- Component-specific CSS files
